This repository is about an app that register and show the number of tusavirus cases for state 

### There is a Tusavirus outbreak in Colombia.

 A national emergency has been declared by the
government. The government has requested each governor to report the number of victims in
their jurisdiction on a virtual platform.
While panicking, governors could send the requested information in inconsistent formats.
Some could send digits, or use their smartphoneâ€™s speech-to-text, while others will send data
in the wrong format because of the sense of urgency.
The government demands the following:
The output of the platform should be the total of victims in the country.
Because of government regulations, you must provide E2E tests using Selenium
or a similar framework.
The platform must be deployed on Heroku (on a free tier) and be publicly
accesible.
